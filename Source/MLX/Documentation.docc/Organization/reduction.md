#  Reduction Functions

Reduction or aggregation functions.

MLX has a number of functions to reduce or aggregate data in `MLXArray`.
These functions typically work over one or more axes, though there are
overloads where the axis can be omitted and the work occurs on the entire array.

For example:

```swift
let array = MLXArray(0 ..< 12, [4, 3])

// scalar array with the sum of all the values
let totalSum = array.sum()

// array with the sum of the colums
let columnSum = array.sum(axis: 0)
```
