## Overview

Examples using ``MLX`` and `MLXNN` are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples). The examples
include:

- [MNISTTrainer](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/blob/main/Applications/MNISTTrainer/README.md): An example that runs on
  both iOS and macOS that downloads MNIST training data and trains a
  [LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet).

- [MLXChatExample](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/blob/main/Applications/MLXChatExample/README.md): An example chat app that runs on both iOS and macOS that supports LLMs and VLMs.

- [LLMEval](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/blob/main/Applications/LLMEval/README.md): A simple example that runs on both iOS
  and macOS that downloads an LLM and tokenizer from Hugging Face and
  generates text from a given prompt.

- [StableDiffusionExample](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/blob/main/Applications/StableDiffusionExample/README.md): An
  example that runs on both iOS and macOS that downloads a stable diffusion model
  from Hugging Face and generates an image from a given prompt.

- [llm-tool](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/blob/main/Tools/llm-tool/README.md): A command line tool for generating text
  using a variety of LLMs available on the Hugging Face hub.

and several more.  Much of the code is also available as a SwiftPM package -- use this as a starting point to build your own applications.
